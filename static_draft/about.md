# Nursing Home Survey Delays 

**Nadia Ghazali**

My current goal is to depict the delays in nursing home inspections due to high surveyor vacancy rates and turnover. I decided to focus on just the timing of the surveys rather than the deficiencies because I felt these were two separate narratives.

I am not facing any major data challenges. However, I am unsure how the surveyor vacancy rates in 2022 were calculated. Is vacancy reflecting a point in time or is it averaged over time? This informs when the 15 month lookback period should be. I am not using mock data. 

**prop_overdue_barchart.svg**: Provides a ranking of all state overdue survey rates in descending order, identifying the states with the most serious survey delays and showing how common survey delays are. This would be a good first visualization because it is easy to interpret and communicates the scope and severity of the issue. 

**overdue_dot_map.svg** This national dot map of all U.S. nursing facilities indicates which facilities have overdue vs. on time surveys. This shows which states have the most serious issues with survey delays and helps the audience understand the scale of the issue/how many nursing homes there are in the U.S.  

**survey_count_heatmap.svg**: This heatmap displays the number of surveys completed throughout the year for each state. This allows the viewer to compare survey completions within and across states over time.

**overdue_rates_chloropleth.svg**: This chloropleth map shows state averages of facility overdue rates. This allows the viewer to quickly get a sense of the range of overdue rates and identify states with the most pressing problems. 
    
**surveyor_beds_vs_prop_overdue_scatter.svg** This scatterplot displays the number of beds per surveyor vs. the state overdue survey rate. I plan to include more information about the the strength of this relationship in the final chart. 

**surveyor_count_vs_prop_overdue_scatter.svg** This scatterplot displays the state number of surveyors vs. the state overdue survey rate. I plan to include more information about the the strength of this relationship in the final chart.  
    
**NH_per_position_vs_prop_overdue_scatter.svg** This scatterplot displays the state number of nursing homes per surveyor vs. the state overdue survey rate. I plan to include more information about the the strength of this relationship in the final chart.  
    
**surveyor_vacancy_by_overdue_survey_scatter.svg** This scatterplot displays the state number of surveyors vs. the state overdue survey rate. I plan to include more information about the correlation in the final chart. This shows a clear relationship between vacant surveyor positions and overdue survey tests. 
 

**I envision my final static project as an online infographic.**
